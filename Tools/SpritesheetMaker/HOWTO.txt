1. Pixrl sprite sheet format

It's a very simple format, using JSON file. It's an array of frame (named "frames") objects with following format:

{
  "id" : 16, "name" : "foo/bar/sprite",
  "x"  : 100, "y"  : 100,
  "w"  : 16, "h"  : 32
}

2. How to make sprite sheets/atlases for use with Pixlr?

Currently sprite atlases can be made with help of TexturePacker (https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) and custom exporter prepared to generate Pixlr format of sprite atlases.

First copy contents of "tp-exporter" to your folder with custom TexturePacker exporters. If you don't have one, you can create one and set it in your TexturePacker GUI app Preferences.

Then you can use either TexturePacker GUI application with "Pixlr" format selected, or script "build-sprite-sheet.sh" in current folder. 

Usage: ./build-sprite-sheet.sh <sprite sheet name> <source folder>
